Originally submitted to Jerma as puzzlepiece.jerma.io. My original plan was for Jerma to try and find a rubiks cube however there were a few problems, notably how all the sounds were far too loud due to me not testing the site at all and how I completely forgot that 500k is basically nothing. Jigsaw in this version is voiced by Ethan White.

A few hours later I submitted a much better version with a working Rubicks cube (taken from https://github.com/tstaylor7/cuber) and new voice lines by Claus, located at https://puzzlepiece.jerma.io/sorry/. I also upped the amount from 500k to 500 million, however I only multiplied the amount taken off by 100 instead of a thousand resulting in it taking ~8 hours for the money to trickle down. People have told me that adds to the joke though so I'll keep it.

Most of this was inspired by [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jerma985/comments/l1gnjv/its_your_choice/) by /u/cherrycruise
